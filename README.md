Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra
============================

Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra (SSO) is a free library of sampled orchestral instruments.  The original version was
created by Mattias Westlund in 2011, and quickly earned a following for its excellent quality and wide selection of
instruments.  This repository hosts the ongoing development of the library.  Mattias is no longer directly involved
(although he has given his permission for continuing to develop it) and has not personally reviewed all of the changes.
In other words, don't email him with questions about it!

The instruments are packaged in SFZ format.  They can be used with any compatible player.  They are tested on
[Sforzando](https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando/) and [sfizz](https://sfz.tools/sfizz/).  Other players often
have less complete support for the format, so some features may not work correctly on them.

[Here are some examples](https://on.soundcloud.com/PgJ4A7YuQGq5kHkz6) created entirely with Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra,
so you can hear what it sounds like.

Instruments with multiple articulations are packaged in two ways.  Use whichever one is more convenient for your
workflow.

- As a separate SFZ instrument for each articulation.
- As a keyswitched instrument with all articulations in a single file.  You can switch between articulations by pressing
  keys outside the range of the instrument.

Most solo instruments have three versions:

- A non-looped version that simply plays each sample once.  This gives the most natural sound, but sets a strict limit
  on how long any note can be held.
- A looped version that can be held indefinitely, but sounds less natural than the non-looped version.
- A looped version that adds a gradual decay and gentle modulation.  This tries to give a more natural sound than the
  simple looped version, but still not place a strict limit on how long notes can be held.  If you are in doubt about
  which version to use, this is usually the best choice.

There are two different solo violin instruments, and likewise two different solo flutes.  In each case, one of the two
instruments has more articulations, but does not offer a looped version.

Many instruments are provided in separate "notation" and "performance" versions.  They differ in how they are controlled.

- Notation instruments use a control system convenient for use in notation programs.
  - All instruments use velocity to set the volume.
  - Marcato articulations use the mod wheel (MIDI CC 1) to adjust the strength of the initial attack.  This
    lets you smoothly blend between a gentle sustain and a strong marcato.
- Performance instruments are better for use in live performance.
  - Long articulations use the mod wheel (MIDI CC 1) to set the volume.  This allows you to continuously
    shape each note.  Many long articulations also use velocity to control the attack rate.
  - Marcato articulations use the mod wheel to set the overall volume and velocity to control the strength of the
    initial attack.
  - Short articulations use velocity to set the volume.

In both control systems, MIDI CC 21 controls the amount of vibrato in string instruments.

Here are definitions of the most common articulations.

**Sustain**: This produces long notes, often with a gentle attack.  The sound continues as long as you hold the note
down (or for non-looped versions, until the end of the sample is reached).  In many cases, the attack rate can be controlled with key velocity.

**Marcato**: This is similar to sustain, but with an accented attack at the beginning.  The strength of the attack
can be controlled with key velocity (for performance instruments) or the mod wheel (for notation instruments).

**Staccato**: Short, strongly accented notes.

**Legato**: This is a monophonic articulation: the instrument can only play one note at a time.  If you press a
new note before releasing the previous one, it smoothly transitions between them with no break in the sound.
On some instruments this is typically described as "slurred" rather than "legato", but for consistency all
instruments use the same name for corresponding articulations.

**Pizzicato**: The player plucks the string with their finger instead of using the bow.

**Col Legno**: More precisely, col legno battuto.  The player strikes the string with the wooden part of
the bow.  When played by an ensemble, this produces a tight cluster of very short, percussive notes.

**Tremolo**: More precisely, this is an unmeasured tremolo.  All the musicians in the section move their bows
back and forth over the string as quickly as possible, not trying to synchronize with each other.  The result
is a pulsing, shimmering sound.

**Harmonics**: More precisely, this is the playing technique known as "artificial harmonics".  The player
lightly touches their finger to a point one quarter of the way along the free part of the string.  This
suppresses many of the vibrational frequencies, leading to a note two octaves higher than written with a
thin, ghostly sound.

Technical Details
-----------------

All samples are stereo, 16 bit, 44 kHz.  Most instruments are sampled in minor 3rds.  Most short articulations
use at least 2x round robin.

Most samples have only a small amount of reverb baked into them, so adding a realistic reverb is important for producing
a good overall sound.  Given that the samples came from a variety of different sources, this is also important for
making them sound like a unified orchestra.
