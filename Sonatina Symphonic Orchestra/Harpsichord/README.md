# Harpsichord

This is the Flemish Harpsichord from Versilian Community Sample Library

played either individually or together.  It has the following changes from the
original version.

- Adjusted the note volumes to make them more uniform.
- Converted samples to FLAC format to save space.
- Changed the keyswitches to be more consistent with other SSO instruments.

This instrument is in the public domain.
