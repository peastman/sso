# Pipe Organ

These samples are based on the [St. Stephen's pipe organ](https://mps-orgelseite.de/home/forum/index.php?thread/1019-st-stephens-st-augustines/&postID=9224)
recorded by Nicholas Appleton.  They have been modified from the original in the following ways.

- They have been converted to FLAC format to save space.
- To further save space, the number of samples has been reduced (sampled in minor thirds instead of chromatically).
- Some samples have been edited to remove noise.
